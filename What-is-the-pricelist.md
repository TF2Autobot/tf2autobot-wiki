# 3.1 A brief explanation

The `pricelist.json` is a file that will be created after you used the `!add` command for the first time and it's stored inside your `files` folder located at `~/tf2autobot/files/steam_account_name/pricelist.json`.

It contains all the items you added via the `!add` command and stores the parameters you set (for example if you want to buy, sell or bank a specific item, which price you set or how many you want to buy).

It is highly recommended that you take regular backups of this file in case you will ever lose access to your machine or your file gets corrupted.
