TF2Autobot uses [prices.tf](https://prices.tf/) (credits to [@Nicklason](https://github.com/Nicklason)) as its autopricing source.

Prices.tf is independent from TF2Autobot and there is no way for us to directly change its prices. 

It may not always accurately represent the current market prices due to not following every price change immediately. It doesn't undercut or overcut.
