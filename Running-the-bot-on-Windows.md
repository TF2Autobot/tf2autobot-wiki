To run the bot you will open up the command prompt by typing `cmd` in your windows search bar.

Once the command prompt is open you will want to `cd` (Change directory) to your tf2autobot folder. In our example installation, we choose to install the bot on the Desktop. 

This means that we will type `cd Desktop\tf2autobot` into the command prompt.

To start the bot we will type `node dist/app.js`

Your bot should be online on Steam in a minute. 

If your bot does not come online you should check the output in the command prompt and see if it matches any of the errors described in our [common errors on startup.](./Common-Errors)

To properly shut down your bot, you can simply click Cltr + C and let it complete all processes, then close the command prompt.

The next thing you should do is set up your pricelist so that your bot can start trading items. Learn how to do it [here.](./What-is-the-pricelist)
